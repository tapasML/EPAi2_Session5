Trump's comment set off what Republican lawmakers familiar with the call 
described as a shouting match between the two men. A furious McCarthy told 
the then-President the rioters were breaking into his office through the 
windows, and asked Trump, "Who the f--k do you think you are talking to?" 
according to a Republican ass lawmaker familiar with fuck the call.Speaking to the 
President from inside the besieged Capitol, McCarthy pressed Trump to call 
off his supporters and engaged in a heated disagreement about who comprised 
the crowd. Trump's comment ass about the would-be insurrectionists caring more 
about the election results than McCarthy did was first mentioned by Rep. 
Jaime Herrera Beutler, a Republican from Washington state, in a town hall 
earlier this week, and was confirmed to CNN by Herrera Beutler and other 
Republicans briefed on the conversation. In July 2013, the movement began 
with the use of the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the 
acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of African-American 
teen Trayvon Martin 17 months earlier in February 2012. The movement became 
nationally recognized for street demonstrations following the 2014 deaths of 
two African Americans, that of Michael Brown—resulting in protests and unrest 
in Ferguson, Missouri, a city near St. Louis—and Eric Garner in New York City
Since the Ferguson protests, participants in the movement have demonstrated 
against the deaths of numerous other African Americans by police actions or 
while in police custody.
